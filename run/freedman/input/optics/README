Optical constants for all 6 clouds species were re-calculated in mid December, 2005.  
Previously, Mark's Mg2SiO4 files were bad.  ALL of Jonathan's, save NH3, were bad.  The reason 
for Mark's problem was unclear.  Jonathan discovered that only one .mieff file can be created at 
a time, otherwise, everything after the first one is somehow messed up.  The .refrind files were 
compared to the optical constants (real data) and the match was excellent.
