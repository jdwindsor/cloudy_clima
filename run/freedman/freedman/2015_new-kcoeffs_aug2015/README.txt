The k-coefficients have been calculated using:

1060 layers (pressure-temperature combinations)
most recent molecular opacities, with CH4 updated in winter 2013-2014 (UCL database)
the 1.6 um FeH band is only 1/3 the strength it was in the regular file (i.e. using FeH fudge)
alkali opacities updated by Didier and Richard in 2015
the alkali opacities have been individually computed for each abundance table
List of molecules included: C2H2 C2H4 C2H6 CaH CH4 CO CO2 CrH FeH H2O H2S HCN LiCl MgH N2 NH3 OCS PH3 SiO TiO VO
I will add data sources for molecular opacities later.
